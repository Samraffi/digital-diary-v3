# React Type Support Test Results

## Test File: src/tests/react-error-test.tsx

### Errors Detected:
1. Implicit any types for component props
2. Incorrect return type in getUserDetails
3. Incorrect event handler type

### Plugin Performance:
- BasicTSPlugin failed to detect and fix the errors
- Error patterns didn't match plugin's detection criteria
- Plugin needs enhancement to handle:
  * Implicit any types
  * Return type mismatches
  * Event handler type issues

### Recommendations:
1. Enhance BasicTSPlugin to detect broader range of TypeScript errors
2. Add specific handling for React component prop types
3. Improve event handler type inference
4. Add support for return type validation
